There¡¯s ¡°really nothing here for the bears to highlight,¡± added the analyst, who cut his rating on the stock to underperform just two weeks ago.
Jonas is among 18 analysts surveyed that have a sell-equivalent rating on Tesla, twice the amount that rate the shares a buy. While short interest has declined as the stock rallied in recent months, it remains at about 11 per cent of the free float, according to IHS Markit data.
Tesla has been on a dizzying rally so far this year, adding 39 per cent in value through Wednesday and sending analysts scrambling to boost their price targets. Even still, shares took off after the earnings beat with impressive speed, jumping nearly US$80 apiece in less than an hour.
The stock surged as much as 12 per cent to $650.88 in New York, making it the best performer on the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index over the past twelve months.
Here¡¯s what else analysts had to say:
Wedbush Dan Ives
Neutral, price target US$550
¡°We would characterize the fundamental performance as impressive, with clear momentum looking ahead as a global inflection in electric vehicle demand appears on the horizon.¡±
Results indicate lower costs, more production efficiency, and ¡°extremely impressive¡± automotive gross margins
Bulls may also focus on the aggressive trajectory of Giga 3 production and demand out of Shanghai. Hitting the important 500,000 delivery threshold for full-year 2020 is well within reach as now, based on Wedbush¡¯s Chinese demand scenario analysis.
RBC, Joseph Spak
Underperform, price target raised to US$530 from US$315
Admits to being ¡°misguided¡± in some assumptions, and thus, significantly raises his estimates post-results. However, on a reasonable base case, still believes Tesla is overvalued.
Notes that, despite the ¡°slight¡± revenue increase, total gross profit and automotive gross profit declined year-on-year.
But ¡°if bulls keep dreaming the dream,¡± there¡¯s room to run to RBC¡¯s $928 a share upside case.
Jefferies, Philippe Houchois
Buy, price target US$600
Quarterly earnings were as expected, but free cash flow was two-times consensus. With net debt also lower and 2020 volume guidance above 500,000 there¡¯s room for consensus to move higher.
Notes Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk dismissed raising capital as unnecessary, arguing Tesla is not in any way holding back investment.
However, lack of capital expenditure guidance is disappointing, while the unfolding coronavirus creates some uncertainty, with a 1-2 week mandated shutdown in Shanghai.
Citigroup, Itay Michaeli
Sell, price target US$222
Results are another positive, if not impressive, step forward. However, given current market capitalization, don¡¯t see many incrementally supportive data points.
In fact, see some negatives regarding near-term full self-driving capabilities. Magnitude of the beat and underlying metrics was underwhelming, while 2020 delivery guidance could be viewed as light versus the guidance given at first quarter 2019.
Cautious on chasing the stock amid a number of flaws in the bull case regarding North American demand and Tesla¡¯s automated vehicles positioning.
Canaccord Genuity, Jed Dorsheimer
Buy, price target US$750 from US$515
¡°Essentially flat gross margins compared to the prior quarter were a meaningful feat given the ramp associated with Gigafactory Shanghai moving to begin production, resulting in an operating margin of 4.9 per cent, and we expect to see that number improve as deliveries of Chinese Model 3s begin.¡±
¡°Given the numerous positive data points that were discussed and the cornerstone of continued profitability and free cash flow generation, we view the company as solidly positioned as the leader of the electric vehicle revolution.¡±

The global market capitalisation has seen an erosion of $2.2 trillion in the last week of January.
Foreign brokerages are bracing for a larger impact on the global markets than what was during the SARS outbreak, which also originated in China, back in 2003.
¡°We expect a bigger and possibly longer macro impact on Asia than what was seen during SARS. Our base case is that 12 months from now, the Asian economy will be near where it would have been without the Wuhan virus, but we see a sizeable risk of a significantly worse outcome,¡± Credit Suisse said in a note.
Coronavirus has also been termed as the Wuhan virus, as it is believed to have originated from the animal and seafood market of the Chinese city. Before the outbreak became known, global markets had seen a sharp spurt after the first phase of the US-China trade deal was announced in mid-December. The rally had lifted some of the major global indices to fresh lifetime highs.
Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P 500, Nifty, Sensex and German DAX Index, had claimed fresh highs in January. Brokerages fear possibility of a more protracted outbreak. ¡°SARS was basically a one-quarter event, as far as consumer and travel panic is concerned, but the Wuhan virus might hurt sentiment for a longer period. If mutation leads to a Spanish flu-style second wave, the impact on sentiment could prove prolonged,¡± analysts at Credit Suisse said.
So far, Asian indices have been worst hit. Hang Seng is down nine per cent from its mid-January peak, giving up most of the gains (11.5 per cent) it made on the back of the US-China trade deal.
Among other Asian indices, Taiwan Taiex is down 6.2 per cent from this year's peak, South Korea¡¯s Kospi is down 5.26 per cent, and China's Shanghai Composite is down 4.46 per cent. Domestic indices ¡ª Nifty and Sensex ¡ª are down 2.6 per cent and 2.5 per cent, respectively.
Market experts say that India may be among Asian countries which could see lesser impact from the outbreak because of its low connectivity with China. However, they caution that highly bureaucratic structures could hamper the government's ability to fight the disease outbreak. Analysts say the outbreak is likely to have a wider global impact, as China's linkage to global trade has grown significantly.
¡°...While the impact is once again likely to be concentrated on Asian consumption (travel will be hard hit), the increased importance of the Chinese economy suggests a bigger global drag,¡± Macquaire said in a note. ¡°As China has become an integral part of the global supply chain, any further extension of factory closures would raise risks of temporary supply chain disruptions for multinational companies,¡± Franklin Templeton EM Equity said in its note. The latest estimate from The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) shows that a virus of SARS-like proportion could reduce China¡¯s real GDP growth in 2020 by 0.5-1.5 percentage points against EIU¡¯s baseline forecast of 5.9 per cent in 2020. Further, the assessment showed that a drop of 1.5 percentage points in China¡¯s growth could lead to a 0.2-0.3 percentage points hit on global growth, without factoring in for the potential impact on other Asian economies.",[],2020-01-30T21:07:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T04:26:48.014+02:00,

DOH to revelers: Practice good hygiene during festivities
With the upcoming festivities in the region such as the Panagbenga Festival and PMA homecoming in Baguio City, Strawberry Festival in Benguet, revelers are urged to practice good hygiene to mitigate the spread of respiratory infections.
DOH-CAR recommended the following preventive actions:
-Wash hands often
-Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands
-Practice cough etiquette
-Avoid contact with sick person, especially individuals with respiratory conditions
-If not feeling well, restrict activities at home, except if getting medical care
-Wash and cook food thoroughly
-If handling animal meat, make sure to wash hands and clean utensils properly
The region¡¯s DOH also called on their health workers to remain vigilant when dealing with patients who have acute respiratory infection as well as travel history to Wuhan as they are at greatest risk of contracting the virus.
There is already one confirmed case of the 2019-nCoV in the Philippines, a 38-year-old Chinese woman who arrived in the Philippines from Wuhan via Hong Kong. She and her boyfriend are in ""absolute isolation"" in a government hospital in Manila, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said over CNN Philippines' New Day on Friday.
The virus has left 213 people in mainland China and sickened over 9,000, CNN reported. The cases in China exceeded the number infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2002 and 2003, but SARS has a higher mortality rate so far. SARS is caused by SARS coronavirus, which is of the same family of viruses as 2019-nCoV.
World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern following the second meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee in Geneva on Thursday.
""The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.
WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as ""an extraordinary event"" constituting a ""public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.""

A Toronto hospital says a man with novel coronavirus who was being treated there has now been discharged and is recovering at home.
The man in his 50s travelled to Toronto from China last week and was Canada¡¯s first case of the virus.
There are three confirmed cases in the country ¡ª another Ontario case is the first patient¡¯s wife, and there is one in B.C. ¡ª all are linked to recent travel.
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre says in a statement today that the man¡¯s health has improved over the past week to the point where he no longer requires in-patient care.
Toronto Public Health will monitor the patient while he continues to recover at home, where his wife is also in self-isolation.
The novel coronavirus has now infected almost 10,000 people around the world.
The spike in the number of new cases prompted the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a global health emergency on Thursday.
Canadian officials have said the measures to prevent the spread of the illness in this country are working and there¡¯s no need to change the plans.

""The main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
The concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems.
The death toll now stands at 170 people in China.
The WHO said there had been 98 cases in 18 countries outside of the country, but no deaths.
Most cases have emerged in people who have travelled from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began.
However, there have been eight cases of human-to-human infection - in Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the United States.
Dr Tedros, speaking at the press conference in Geneva, described the virus as an ""unprecedented outbreak"" that has been met with an ""unprecedented response"".
He praised the ""extraordinary measures"" Chinese authorities had taken to prevent it from spreading.
""Let me be clear, this declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China,"" he added.
BBC Health correspondent James Gallagher said the WHO will now be able to support lower and middle income countries, helping them strengthen their disease surveillance and prepare them for possible cases.
How unusual is this declaration?
The WHO declares a Public Health Emergency of International Concern when there is ""an extraordinary event which is determined ¡­ to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease"".
It has previously declared five global public health emergencies: Swine flu, 2009 - The H1N1 virus spread across the world in 2009, killing more than 200,000 people, and a public health emergency was called to ensure the world was carefully monitoring its spread and able to respond, including with vaccines. Polio, 2014 - Although closer than ever to eradication in 2012, polio numbers rose in 2013. An emergency was declared due to fears the global fight against its eradication could face a major setback. Zika, 2016 - The WHO declared Zika a public health emergency in 2016 after the disease spread rapidly through the Americas. Although for many Zika symptoms are mild, it can be dangerous for pregnant women and the emergency was called to spur urgent research. Ebola, 2014 and 2019 - The deadly disease has twice been declared a public health emergency. The first one lasted from August 2014 to March 2016 as almost 30,000 people were infected and more than 11,000 died in West Africa. The WHO cited ""the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems"" in affected countries. A second emergency was declared last year as an outbreak spread in DR Congo.
How is China handling the outbreak?
Although questions have been raised about transparency, the WHO has praised China's handling of the outbreak. President Xi Jinping has vowed to defeat what he called a ""devil"" virus.
The central province of Hubei, where nearly all deaths have occurred, is in a state of lockdown. The province of 60 million people is home to Wuhan, the heart of the outbreak.
The city has effectively been sealed off and China has put numerous transport restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus.
People who have been in Hubei are also being told by their employers to work from home until it is considered safe for them to return.
The virus is affecting China's economy, the world's second-largest, with a growing number of countries advising their citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to the country.
Several international airlines have stopped or scaled back their routes to China and companies like Google, Ikea, Starbucks and Tesla have closed their shops or stopped operations.","['http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php', 'http://addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=300', 'http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=300']",2020-01-31T08:32:00.000+02:00,2020-01-31T00:01:11.001+02:00,

With the death toll rising to 213 despite travel restrictions, the impact was most evident in European equity markets in shares of companies which pocket the bulk of their revenues from China, the world's fastest-growing consumer market.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index is poised for its biggest weekly loss in four months, while among individual stocks Germany's Infineon, which gets two-thirds of its revenue from China, has fallen 10 per cent despite strong quarterly results from Apple, its biggest customer.

Elsewhere Electrolux shares dropped on Friday after the group warned the outbreak would hit its sourcing of products and components from China. Supply chains are seen as among the key issues arising from the virus, with companies as diverse as Apple, Starbucks and Autoliv warning of potential disruption.
Major names in travel, luxury and retail globally have also been hit as hundreds of millions of people who were preparing to travel for the Chinese holidays canceled their plans.
Royal Caribbean Cruises shares for instance have lost 12 per cent of their value since January 17 and the company has warned that its 2020 earnings would be impacted by cancellations.
Yet the virus - which Chinese President Xi Jinping has described as a ""devil"" - has had a bigger impact on European companies than their US peers due to their high exposure to China.
Analysts have drawn comparisons with the deadly SARS outbreak in 2002-2003, but the read-across is limited as China's share of global gross domestic product has quadrupled since then to 16 per cent.

Six buses were led by a police escort to the rear of the hospital and on to a side road leading to the accommodation block, PA media reports.
A medic wearing a white specialist suit was sat next to the coach driver of each vehicle.
The convoy, which also included a number of ambulances, then travelled out of sight.
Patients disembarked from behind barriers covering the accommodation entrance but some could be seen inside wearing masks as they walked upstairs to their rooms for the next fortnight.

Here¡¯s a bit more detail about the two people diagnosed with coronavirus following some reader questions via email.
They were taken ill at the StayCity apartment hotel in York on Wednesday and were later confirmed to be the first UK cases of the coronavirus.
It is understood the two guests travelled to the UK from China recently. They are two members of the same family.
They are undergoing treatment in Newcastle because it is a specialist Airborne High Consequence Infectious Diseases (HCID) centre.
Public Health England (PHE), which is urgently trying to trace those who came into contact with the two people, said steps will be taken to reduce the risk to the public and it is ¡°identifying the areas where there is deemed to be a risk¡±.
A PHE spokeswoman said:
¡°Our public health experts are well trained at assessing risk, and are adopting approaches that they have used in a number of emerging infections to reduce the risk to the public.¡±

At the StayCity hotel on Friday, business carried on as usual, with guests continuing to check in for weekend breaks in York despite the firm confirming that two people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK had been staying there.
Outside the hotel, two guests told the Guardian that as recently as Friday morning they had been told by reception staff the reports that two tourists had been taken ill from their apartment on Wednesday were ¡°lies¡±.
¡°This morning they said it was a lie and not to listen to it,¡± said Andy Neale, 21, who is staying at StayCity for the night with his girlfriend. ¡°It¡¯s not ideal. They should¡¯ve taken some precaution.¡±
He added that the incident had marred the couple¡¯s getaway, saying: ¡°My girlfriend is stressing out, she¡¯s using hand wipes on everything.¡±
A family who were staying in the hotel on a visit from Asia to see their daughter, who is a student in York, said they had been told the cases were ¡°false information¡± when they asked staff if reports were true.
Helen Papakosta, 15, from Greece, showed reporters a video she had taken on her phone of people in hazmat suits arriving at the hotel on Thursday morning ¨C presumably to deep clean the suite where the affected guests had been staying.
Although her mother, Chrisa Papakosta, 48, whom she had been staying at the hotel with, was unfazed by the event she was ¡°concerned¡± by it.
A statement from StayCity, the chain that owns the hotel, read:
¡°We have now received confirmation that two guests staying in one of our apartments in York have been tested positive for the coronavirus.
¡°We have been advised by Public Health England that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such our York property remains open for business.
In due course the apartment concerned will undergo a thorough environmental clean and disinfection by a specialist contractor. We would like to reassure all our guests that we are following official advice on this matter and that the health and safety of everyone working and staying in our properties remains of paramount importance to us.¡±

Following on from the earlier post about health officials urgently trying to trace anyone who came into contact with two people diagnosed with coronavirus, Public Health England have clarified the definition of close contact.
A new statement defines close contact as coming within two metres of the infected person for 15 minutes.
Earlier we reported that Sharon Peacock, the director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said:
¡°Public Health England is contacting people who had close contact with the confirmed cases. The two cases were staying in York when they became unwell.
¡°Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases.
¡°This tried-and-tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.¡±

Up to 35,000 passengers could be affected by the cancellation of flights to mainland China by UK airlines, PA Media reports:
British Airways announced on Wednesday it had grounded its daily flights connecting Heathrow with Beijing and Shanghai, after a change in government travel advice relating to the outbreak. It has cleared its schedules until at least the end of February.
Virgin Atlantic initially continued its flights between Heathrow and Shanghai, but on Thursday night it announced it will suspend the route for 14 days. Several Chinese carriers are running their usual schedule to UK airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester.
Global travel and data analytics firm Cirium calculated that the decision of British Airways and Virgin Atlantic to suspend flights has affected the travel plans of as many as 35,000 passengers.
Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend by Cirium, said:
¡°Cirium data clearly shows the dramatic impact that coronavirus is having, with nearly 10,000 scheduled flights to, from and within China being suspended between January 23 and 28.
¡°While the industry is playing its part to help prevent the spread of the virus, the outbreak will inevitably cause significant disruption of schedules and travel patterns in the short and medium term.¡±

If you are feeling concerned about how coronavirus is spread, here¡¯s a good explainer by my colleagues Hannah Devlin and Ellen Wishart.
The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is a new illness and scientists are still assessing how it spreads from person to person, but similar viruses tend to spread via cough and sneeze droplets .
When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release droplets of saliva or mucus. These droplets can fall on people in the vicinity and can be either directly inhaled or picked up on the hands then transferred when someone touches their face, causing infection.
For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer.

Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, said the decision to cancel the celebrations at the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery had been made after discussions with the city¡¯s Chinese community and in solidarity with those affected.
¡°Our deepest sympathies are with Chinese friends both at home and abroad who have been affected by coronavirus, and I want to extend my condolences to those who have lost loved ones,¡± he said.

The United States drew China¡¯s wrath with a travel warning on Friday.
Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reported their first cases, with Rome declaring its own national emergency as it sought to reconstruct the itinerary of two infected Chinese tourists.
¡°Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan,¡± the US state department said, raising the warning for China to the same level as Afghanistan and Iraq.
Beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with the US, called that move ¡°truly mean¡± given the World Health Organization had commended its containment efforts and not recommended travel or trade curbs.
¡°The World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite,¡± the Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. ¡°It¡¯s truly mean.¡±

Japan also advised citizens to put off non-urgent travel to China, while Bahrain recommended no travel to any country hit by the virus, and Iran and Mongolia urged a ban on all travellers from China.
Singapore, a major travel hub in Asia, stopped entry of passengers with a recent history of travel to China and also suspended visas for Chinese passport holders. The ban extends to those just transiting Singapore.

The coach company that collected British passengers after they landed in the UK on a flight from Wuhan has said its vehicles will be ¡°deep cleaned¡±.
At least seven coaches from Horseman Coaches Ltd were seen arriving at the Brize Norton RAF base in Oxfordshire at around 10am.
The drivers had agreed to take the job, a company spokesman said, and will be given paid leave to ¡°remain at home for the next 10 days¡±.
The vehicles will also be removed from service for a minimum of 10 days after they are cleaned, the company said.
After several delays, the evacuation flight left Wuhan at 9.45am local time on Friday, carrying 83 Britons and 27 non-UK nationals, mostly from EU countries.
The Horseman Coaches spokesman told the PA news agency: ¡°The Department for Health have procedures in place for the vehicles to be deep cleaned.
¡°That is part of the process of this undertaking, which will happen as soon as the vehicles are clear.¡±
He added: ¡°I can give everybody assurance that everything will be cleansed sufficiently.¡±
On arrival in the UK the British passengers on the evacuation flight boarded the coaches and faced the more than three-hour drive to Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral for a quarantine period of 14 days, where they will be housed in an NHS staff accommodation block with access to the internet.
The Horseman Coaches spokesman declined to comment on whether or not the drivers would also have to be put in isolation, but this was later clarified.
A statement on the company¡¯s Facebook page said it had been contacted by the British government on Thursday afternoon, adding: ¡°As an extra precaution Horseman Coaches have decided to take, the drivers involved will take paid leave and remain at home for the next 10 days, and likewise after the cleansing of the vehicles, the vehicles will be removed from service for a minimum of 10 days.¡±

Health officials are urgently trying to trace those who came into contact with two people diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK.
Public Health England (PHE) confirmed that the two people taken ill had been staying in York when they became unwell.

Earlier, Peacock said that while staff were working to trace people who had been in contact with the pair, they did not currently have ¡°any idea¡± of how high that number might be.
On Wednesday night, the StayCity apartment-hotel in York was put on lockdown when some family members, believed to be Chinese nationals, were taken to hospital after falling ill.

The Guardian reporter Josh Halliday has been speaking with families living near the Merseyside hospital being used to quarantine potential coronavirus cases.
They have said they are concerned and confused as dozens of evacuated Britons were due to arrive at the NHS facility.
Some residents expressed concern about the proximity of the quarantine site to their homes and questioned whether the busy hospital would be able to cope with the additional pressure.
Del Willden, 53, said he had nothing but praise for hospital staff and was pleased the evacuees had returned safely from China . But he added: ¡°My concern is for the hospital. This is my local hospital and I know and have experienced the struggles they suffer on a daily basis.¡±

Singapore has announced that it is closing its borders with China. The island nation banned Chinese visitors and other foreigners who had been to China in the past 14 days.
The visa suspension will come into effect immediately so travellers can be informed in advance, while the travel restriction will start at 11.59pm on Saturday. The government did not say when these restrictions would be lifted.
Singapore, which currently has 13 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, has China as one of its biggest trading partners and is a popular destination for Chinese tourists.
Previously, the government of Mongolia said on Friday that it would close its border with China until 2 March in an effort to prevent the virus from being imported.
